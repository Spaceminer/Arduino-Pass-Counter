Arduino Ski Pass Counter
========================

Purpose
-------

The Arduino Ski Pass Counter was a project
originally formed to resolve the issue of 
people forgetting to record their passes made
on a shared club boat, so that they could be 
charged the appropriate share of the gas bill.

Originally, this device was to preform the 
following tasks:

  1. Contain a navigable list of names
  2. Have the ability to select a name to track
  3. Display the passes tracked on a specific name

However, as the project advanced, more and more 
features were planned. 

Features
--------

Current:

  * 3-Button + LCD Interface
  * Individual Names w/ Passes and Totals recorded
  * Toggleable Tracking
  * Manual pass addition and subtraction
  * Ability to use external sensor to add passes
  * Two button combo to reset passes
  * Three button combo when on specific name to reset *all*

Planned:

  * Save passes and Totals to SD card
  * Get name data from SD memory (Not hardcoded)
  * (Most likely more to come)
